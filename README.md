## Project Time and Date

<img src="/calendar.png" width="100"  />

### The goal of this project is to practice working with JavaScript and the DOM

We will use HTML, CSS and JavaScript for our project.

**Basic functionality:** we want our programme to run the current date and current time and show this in the browser. A very simple example is:

<img src="#" />


### For starters

1. Create a new folder on your local computer with the name: project-time-date
1. Create an index.html file with the general template code
1. Create a style.css file and add this to your HTML file as `<link>` (check how to add CSS to an HTML file)
1. Make sure you have *Time and Date* as the title (this will show in the tab when your app runs in the browser)
1. Build the page according to the example: the page should show the date as day-month-year and the time as hour-minutes-seconds
1. If you want to challenge yourself, try to make the page more attractive 


### For more advanced students

1. Build this project as React app
1. Use create-react-app, create components and write the code for the functionality explained above
1. Challenge yourself: use different time zones and build the time and date functionality for each zone
1. Make it into an attractive app
