![Your Timer](https://github.com/Jethet/project-timer/blob/master/timerScreenshot.png)

This is a simple timer to set an amount of time for a task. The time is set in minutes. After the time has elapsed, an alert is shown and a sound (windchimes) is played.

The user can set the time and click 'Start' for the timer to run. The user can stop and reset the time as well. The actual time of day is shown in the timer as a reference.

The timer has been built with JavaScript, HTML and CSS, working with the DOM. The idea is that the user can use the timer in a browser window and minimize that window somewhere in a corner of their screen, and keep the timer running there.

The font used to display the time is Recurso Sans, an open font used under the ![SIL Open Font License](https://fontlibrary.org/en/font/recurso-sans). This font has been chosen to give the numbers the look of stopwatch numbers. The font used for the rest of the text (also on buttons and in input field) is GNU Unifont, a free and open-source bitmap font by ![Roman Czyborra and Paul Hardy](https://fontlibrary.org/en/font/gnu-unifont). The icon of the hourglass is an open source icon made by ![Flat Icons](https://www.flaticon.com/authors/flat-icons).

Possible functionality to be added:
- Option to create an activity for which the user can set time and add a title to that activity.
- Option for the user to save time spent on a specific activity.
- Option to filter activities to get total time spent on a specific activity.
