# project-timer

This is a simple timer to set an amount of time for a task. The time is set in minutes. After the time has elapsed, an alert is shown and a sound (windchimes) is played.

The user can set the time and click 'Start' for the timer to run. The user can stop and reset the time as well. The actual time of day is shown in the timer as a reference.

The timer has been built with JavaScript, HTML and CSS, working with the DOM.

Possible functionality to be added:
- Option to create an activity for which the user can set time and add a title to that activity.
- Option for the user to save time spent on a specific activity.
- Option to filter activities to get total time spent on a specific activity.
