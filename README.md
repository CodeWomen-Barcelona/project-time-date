# project-timer

This is a simple timer to set an amount of time for a task. The time is set in minutes. After the time has elapsed, an alert is shown and a sound is played.

The user can set the time and click 'Start' for the timer to run. The user can stop and reset the time as well. The actual time of day is shown in the timer as a reference.

The timer has been built with JavaScript, HTML and CSS, working with the DOM.
